  systemPrompt: `## Architecture: API-driven Web Application

This system is an API-driven web application with the following architectural constraints:

### Communication
- Components communicate via REST HTTP endpoints
- Each resource has its own set of endpoints (CRUD)
- Standard HTTP status codes: 200 (ok), 201 (created), 204 (no content), 400 (bad request), 404 (not found)
- All responses are JSON. Errors: { "error": "message" }

### Data Ownership
- Each resource module owns exclusive mutation authority over its database table(s)
- Cross-resource queries use JOINs for read-only access
- Foreign key relationships must be validated before mutation (check referenced row exists)
- Cascade protection: cannot delete a parent resource that has dependent children

### Component Grain
- One module per resource (e.g., tasks, projects, categories)
- Each module is independently deployable and testable
- A web UI module serves HTML and calls the resource modules via fetch()

### Evaluation Surface
- Every module is testable via HTTP endpoint contracts
- Create → verify response has ID and matches input
- Read → verify response shape matches schema
- Update → verify changes are persisted
- Delete → verify resource is gone
- Validation → verify 400 for invalid input
- Not found → verify 404 for missing resources

### Translating user requirements to implementation
- "Users can create X" → POST endpoint with validation
- "Users can view X" → GET endpoint with SELECT query (JOINs for related data)
- "Users can edit X" → PATCH endpoint with UPDATE query
- "Users can delete X" → DELETE endpoint with safety checks
- "Users can filter by Y" → query parameters on GET endpoints
- "Show X sorted by Y" → ORDER BY in query
- "X must be visually highlighted" → UI concern, not API
- "Expose a programmatic interface" → the REST API IS the programmatic interface
